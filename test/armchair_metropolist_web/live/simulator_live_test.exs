  LiveView tests for the city dashboard.

  `async: false`: the engine is a singleton registered under its module name
  and these tests inject application-env stub adapters, same as
  `city_engine_test.exs`. The test environment does not start the engine
  itself (`start_simulation: false` in `config/test.exs`, so it does not
  collide with `start_supervised!`/the Ecto sandbox), so each test starts its
  own `CityEngine` pointed at the in-memory `StubSnapshotRepository`.
